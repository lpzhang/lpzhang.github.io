I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow specializing in machine learning for medical imaging at the [Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging](https://www.martinos.org), Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts General Hospital, under the mentorship of [Prof. Fang Liu](https://www.martinos.org/investigator/fang-liu/). My research focuses on advancing medical image processing and analysis through deep learning, with an emphasis on image segmentation, synthesis, reconstruction, and super-resolution. My work aims to enhance image quality and develop AI-driven solutions that address real-world clinical challenges, contributing to the advancement of medical diagnostics and patient care.

Prior to joining Harvard, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Imaging and Interventional Radiology](https://www.diir.cuhk.edu.hk/) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) (CUHK), supervised by [Prof. Weitian Chen](https://www.diir.cuhk.edu.hk/staff/weitian-chen/). I earned my Ph.D. in Imaging and Interventional Radiology from CUHK in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Simon Chun Ho Yu](https://www.cuhkmc.hk/professionals/dr-simon-yu-chun-ho) and [Prof. Lin Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-TW&user=IbUw_4wAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Before my Ph.D., I worked as a Research Assistant in [Prof. Xiaogang Wang](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/professors/prof-xiaogang-wang)’s lab at CUHK’s Department of Electronic Engineering. I completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2014 and obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Instrument Science and Technology from the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/schools), where I was mentored by [Prof. Hui Zhao](https://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/english/detail/843_861.htm).
